    Utilizing the permeance definition (``magnetic conductance'') 
    \begin{equation}
        \Lambda = \frac{\phi}{N i},
    \end{equation}
    \pause
    we can represent \eqref{eq:flux_matrix_transformer} as:
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_{11} = \Lambda_{11} N_1 i_1, \quad \phi_{12} = \Lambda_{12} N_2 i_2, \quad \phi_{21} = \Lambda_{21} N_1 i_1, \quad \phi_{22} = \Lambda_{22} N_2 i_2.

    The resulting flux linkage per coil is then:

        \label{eq:flux_linkage_transformer}

    Hence, we can define the flux linkages of both coils using the following inductance matrix:
    \begin{equation}
        \bm{\psi} = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} L_1 & M_{12} \\ M_{21} & L_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_1 \\ i_2 \end{bmatrix} = \bm{L}\bm{i}.
        \label{eq:flux_linkage_matrix_transformer}
    \end{equation}
    \pause
    Due to the symmetry of the inductive coupling, the mutual inductances are identical:
    \begin{equation}
        M_{12} = M_{21} = M.
    \end{equation}
    \pause
    Based on \eqref{eq:flux_linkage_transformer}, we can also split the self-inductance $L_i$ of the $i$-th coil into the sum of the leakage inductance $L_{i,\sigma}$ and the magnetizing inductance $L_{i,\mathrm{m}}$:
    \begin{equation}
        L_i = L_{i,\sigma} + L_{i,\mathrm{m}} = \Lambda_{ii}N_i^2 + \Lambda_{ji}N_i^2 \quad \mbox{with} \quad i \neq j. 
        \label{eq:inductance_split}
    \end{equation}
    \pause
    Finally, we can define the coupling coefficient $k$ as:
    \begin{equation}
        k = \frac{M}{\sqrt{L_1 L_2}}, \qquad 0 \leq k \leq 1,
        \label{eq:coupling_coefficient}
    \end{equation}
    which indicates how strong or week the inductive coupling between the coils is.

    Considering magnetostatic situations where the displacement current can be neglected, Amp\`ere's law reads:
    \begin{equation}
        \oint_{\partial S} \bm{H} \cdot \mathrm{d}\bm{s} = I_{\mathrm{f}} = N I = \sum_k  \theta_k = \sum_k l_k H_k.
        \label{eq:ampere_law_magnetic_network}
    \end{equation}
    \pause
    So far, the equation has not the structure of the second Kirchhoff’s law (loop rule). However, we can force this desired format by placing the term with the electric currents on the left-hand side of the equation:
    \begin{equation}
         \sum_k \theta_k - \theta_0 = 0 \quad \mbox{with} \quad \theta_0 = N I \,\,\mbox{(MMF term)}.

    With Ohm's law and the material conductivity $\sigma$, we get the current density $J$:
    $$
        J(x,t) = \sigma E(x,t) = -x\sigma\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}.
    $$\pause 
    Inserting the assumed magnetic flux density distribution it follows:
    $$
        J(x,t) = -x\sigma\omega\hat{B}\cos(\omega t).
    $$\pause
    The relative power loss (per volume) density $p(x,t)$ results in:
    $$
    p(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sigma} J^2(x,t) = x^2\sigma\omega^2\hat{B}^2\cos^2(\omega t).
    $$\pause
    The average power loss per volume (considering the $x$-direction) is:
    $$
    p(t) = \frac{1}{d} \int_{-d/2}^{d/2} p(x,t) \mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{12}\sigma\omega^2 d^2 \hat{B}^2\cos^2(\omega t).
