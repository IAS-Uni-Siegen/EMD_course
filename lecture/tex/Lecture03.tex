                \item They are also true DC machines, as the current and flux paths are unidirectional.
                \item<2-> The general design prevents connecting multiple rotor turns in series to increase the voltage, that is, only a relatively low voltage is induced.
                \item<3-> Consequently, homopolar machines require high currents (in the order of  \si{\kilo\ampere} or even \si{\mega\ampere}) to reach a useful power range which limited their application.

		\item $z_\mathrm{cw} / z_\mathrm{a}$: number of conductors of the compensation  and armature windings.
	\end{itemize} \pause
	In \eqref{eq:MMF_compensation_winding} $\alpha$ is only related to $\theta_\mathrm{a}$ as we assume the armature area to be bigger (or at least the same size) as the field pole (cf. \figref{fig:Compensation_winding_interpoles}). \pause From \eqref{eq:MMF_compensation_winding} we can calculate the required compensation winding conductors

			As the start up of a DC machine with a fixed armature voltage $U_\mathrm{a}$ can lead to very high armature currents, which potentially cause damage, \hl{dropping resistors can be used to limit the armature current}. While this approach was historically very common (e.g., in rail vehicles), its additional power losses and the necessity to carry bulky resistors are obvious drawbacks.

			Now we \hl{consider $U_\mathrm{a}$ being controllable} (e.g., via buck converter), that is, we can also change $I_\mathrm{a}$. Nevertheless, the machine is still limited by the voltage and current constraint:
			\begin{equation}
				U_\mathrm{max} \leq U_\mathrm{a} = \frac{R_\mathrm{a}}{\psi_\mathrm{f}'} T + \omega \psi_\mathrm{f}', \qquad I_\mathrm{max} \leq I_\mathrm{a}.
				\label{eq:Operation_constraints_sep_DC_machine}
			\end{equation} \pause
			For sake of simplicity we only consider the first quadrant (cf. \figref{fig:machine_quadrants}), that is, positive torque and speed mode. \pause From \eqref{eq:Operation_constraints_sep_DC_machine} $T\leq \psi_\mathrm{f}' I_\mathrm{max}$ follows. \pause Also, the maximum speed is limited:
			\begin{equation}
				\omega \leq \frac{U_\mathrm{max}}{\psi_\mathrm{f}'} - \frac{R_\mathrm{a}}{\psi_\mathrm{f}'^2} T.
			\end{equation} \pause
			Hence, for a constant excitation $\psi_\mathrm{f}'$, the torque must be reduced starting at $\omega_1$ while $\omega_0$ represents the no-load speed where no torque can be generated anymore:
			\begin{equation}
				\omega_1 = \frac{U_\mathrm{max}}{\psi_\mathrm{f}'} - \frac{R_\mathrm{a}}{\psi_\mathrm{f}'} I_\mathrm{max}, \qquad \omega_0 = \frac{U_\mathrm{max}}{\psi_\mathrm{f}'}.

			In the previous scenario, the no-load speed $\omega_0$ is limited by the maximum armature voltage $U_\mathrm{max}$. However, if the field winding current $I_\mathrm{f}$ is also controllable, the no-load speed can be increased by \hl{decreasing the excitation $\psi_\mathrm{f}'$} (so-called field weakening). \pause Consider an armature operation both at the voltage and current constraint:
			\begin{equation}
				U_\mathrm{max}  = R_\mathrm{a} I_\mathrm{max} + \omega \psi_\mathrm{f}'= R_\mathrm{a} I_\mathrm{max} + \omega L_\mathrm{f}' i_\mathrm{f}.
			\end{equation} \pause
			For $\omega > \omega_1$ the field weakening is applied by reducing $i_\mathrm{f}$ to stay exactly at the armature voltage constraint:
			\begin{equation}
				i_\mathrm{f} = \frac{1}{\omega}\frac{U_\mathrm{max} - R_\mathrm{a} I_\mathrm{max}}{L_\mathrm{f}'}.
			\end{equation} \pause
			Hence, we need to reduce the excitation with $1/\omega$ resulting in the torque and mechanical power
			\begin{equation}
				T = \frac{1}{\omega} \left(U_\mathrm{max}I_\mathrm{max} - R_\mathrm{a} I_\mathrm{max}^2\right), \qquad P_\mathrm{me} = U_\mathrm{max}I_\mathrm{max} - R_\mathrm{a} I_\mathrm{max}^2.
