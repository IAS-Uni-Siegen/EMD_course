                A transformer is a static device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. It converts the AC voltage levels between inputs and outputs.   
            \end{varblock}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item While a transformer is sometimes called a ``static~machine'', it does not meet the formal definition of an electrical machine (compare first chapter).
                \item However, transformers share some working principles with electrical machines and are also often used as components of electrical power systems including drives.

		The dynamic transformer behavior can be represented by the ECD in \figref{fig:General_transformer_ECD}, which also considers the internal resistances of the windings. Applying Faraday's law, the resulting differential equations are:
		\begin{align}
			u_1(t) = R_1 i_1(t) + \frac{\mathrm{d}\psi_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}, \qquad u_2(t) = R_2 i_2(t) + \frac{\mathrm{d}\psi_2(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}. \label{eq:transformer_differential_equations}

		Rearranging \eqref{eq:transformer_differential_equations_matrix_form} gives the state-space representation of the transformer model

			\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\bm{i}(t) = \bm{L}^{-1}\left(\bm{u}(t)-\bm{R}\bm{i}(t) \right)

		Above, $\sigma$ is the leakage coefficient defined as (compare also \eqref{eq:coupling_coefficient})
		\begin{equation}
			\sigma = \frac{L_1 L_2 -M^2}{L_1 L_2 } = 1 - \frac{M^2}{ L_1 L_2} = 1 - k^2 .
		\end{equation}
		Finally, the state-space representation of the transformer model is
		\begin{equation}
			\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.3} 
			\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\bm{i}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{R_1}{\sigma L_1} & \frac{R_2 M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} \\ \frac{R_1 M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} & -\frac{R_2}{\sigma L_1} \end{bmatrix} \bm{i}(t) + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sigma L_1} & -\frac{M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} \\ -\frac{M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} & \frac{1}{\sigma L_2} \end{bmatrix} \bm{u}(t) = \bm{A} \bm{i}(t) + \bm{B} \bm{u}(t) .

%% Steady-state of the single-phase transformer %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Steady-state modeling of the single-phase transformer}
		Assuming that the transformer operates in steady state and that all quantities are sinusoidal, the state-space model \eqref{eq:transformer_state_space_02} can be simplified and represented by complex phasors:
			$$x(t) = \hat{x} \cos(\omega_\mathrm{el} t+ \varphi_{\mathrm{x}}) = \mathrm{Re}\left\{\hat{x} e^{\iu (\omega_\mathrm{el} t + \varphi_{\mathrm{x}})}\right\}= \mathrm{Re}\left\{\underline{X} e^{\iu \omega_\mathrm{el} t}\right\}.$$
		From \eqref{eq:transformer_differential_equations_matrix_form} we recieve
		\begin{align}
			\bm{\underline{U}} = \begin{bmatrix} \underline{U}_1 \\ \underline{U}_2 \end{bmatrix} = \bm{R}\bm{\underline{I}} + \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} \bm{L}\bm{\underline{I}} = \bm{\underline{Z}}\, \bm{\underline{I} } = \begin{bmatrix} R_1 + \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} L_1 & \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} M \\ \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} M & R_2 + \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} L_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \underline{I}_1 \\ \underline{I}_2 \end{bmatrix}.
			\label{eq:transformer_steady_state_voltage_response}
		\end{align}
		For some given $\bm{\underline{U}}$ we can calculate the current phasors $\bm{\underline{I}}$ (i.e., the steady-state current response) by solving:
		\begin{align}
			\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.3} 
			\bm{\underline{I}} = \bm{\underline{Z}}^{-1} \bm{\underline{U}} .
			\label{eq:transformer_steady_state_current_response}
		\end{align}
		Alternative scenarios can be also considered, e.g., defining $\underline{U}_1$ (input voltage) and $\underline{I}_2$ (load current) as given and solving for $\underline{I}_1$ and $\underline{U}_2$ by rearranging \eqref{eq:transformer_steady_state_voltage_response}. 
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Steady-state of the single-phase transformer (cont.) %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Steady-state modeling of the single-phase transformer (cont.)}
		Assuming that the transformer is not loaded ($I_2 = 0$) and that it is lossless ($R_1 = 0$), \eqref{eq:transformer_steady_state_voltage_response} simplifies to
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{bmatrix} \underline{U}_1 \\ \underline{U}_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} L_1  \\ \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} M  \end{bmatrix} \underline{I}_1.
		\end{equation}
		The voltage transformation ratio in this case results in
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{U_1}{U_2} = \frac{\iu \omega_{\mathrm{el}} L_1 I_1}{\iu \omega_{\mathrm{el}} M I_1}  = \frac{L_1}{M}.
		\end{equation}
		Assuming further that the transformer is leakage-free ($L_{1,\sigma}=0$), the voltage transformation ratio simplifies to (compare also \eqref{eq:inductance_split})
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{U_1}{U_2} = \frac{L_1}{M} = \frac{\Lambda_{21}N_1^2}{\Lambda_{21}N_1 N_2} I_1 = \frac{N_1}{N_2} = \ddot{u}.
			\label{eq:voltage_transformation_ratio}
		\end{equation}
		Hence, this famous result is only valid for the abstract case of a lossless, leakage-free, and, unloaded transformer -- i.e., not applicable to real-world transformers.

%% Transformation of the secondary side variables %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Transformation of the secondary side variables}
		Sometimes it can be helpful to (mathematically) transform the secondary side variables to ease the mathematical analysis. This can be done by introducing the transformation factor $\alpha$:
		\begin{equation}
			u_2' = \alpha u_2, \qquad i_2' = \frac{1}{\alpha} i_2.
		\end{equation}
		Here, $u_2'$ and $i_2'$ are the transformed secondary side voltage and current, respectively. The primary voltage equation reads
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{split}
			u_1(t) &= R_1 i_1(t) + L_1 \frac{\mathrm{d}i_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} + M \frac{\mathrm{d}i_2(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}  = R_1 i_1 (t)+ L_1 \frac{\mathrm{d}i_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}  + \alpha M \frac{\mathrm{d}i_2'(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}  \\&= R_1 i_1(t) + L_1 \frac{\mathrm{d}i_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} + M' \frac{\mathrm{d}i_2'(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		with the transformed mutual inductance $M' = \alpha M$. 
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Transformation of the secondary side variables (cont.) %%

			\Leftrightarrow \quad u_2'(t) &= \alpha^2 R_2 i_2'(t) + \alpha^2 L_2 \frac{\mathrm{d}i_2'(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} + \alpha M \frac{\mathrm{d}i_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}\\
			\Leftrightarrow \quad u_2'(t) &=  R'_2 i_2'(t) + L'_2 \frac{\mathrm{d}i_2'(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} + M' \frac{\mathrm{d}i_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}
		\end{split}

		with the transformed resistance $R'_2 = \alpha^2 R_2$ and inductance $L'_2 = \alpha^2 L_2$.

	Here, we consider a pure sinusoidal operation with $I_\mathrm{c}$ and $U_1$ being root-mean-square (RMS) values. Obviously, this is only a very rough model approximation (compare \figref{fig:Hyteresis_curve_full} and \figref{fig:Eddy_currents_lamination}), but for many transformer designs the core losses can be significant and neglecting them completely would not be justified.

	with $Z_\mathrm{s}$ being the short-circuit impedance while assuming that the impedance across $M'$ and $R_{\mathrm{c}}$ is much larger, i.e., the short-circuit current will not flow via this branch. Hence, we have
	\begin{equation}
		R_1+R'_2 = Z_\mathrm{s}\cos(\varphi_{\mathrm{s}}), \quad X_{L_{1,\sigma}} + X_{L'_{2,\sigma}} = Z_\mathrm{s} \sin(\varphi_{\mathrm{s}}).
	\end{equation}  
	Since we have four remaining unknown component values but only two independent equations, we additionally assume a symmetrical transformer design, leading to
	\begin{equation}
		R_1 = R'_2 = \frac{1}{2}Z_\mathrm{s}\cos(\varphi_{\mathrm{s}}), \quad \omega_{\mathrm{el}}L_{1,\sigma} =  X_{L_{1,\sigma}} = \omega_{\mathrm{el}}L'_{2,\sigma} = X_{L'_{2,\sigma}} = \frac{1}{2} Z_\mathrm{s} \sin(\varphi_{\mathrm{s}}).

	Typically the short-circuit test voltage $U_{1,\mathrm{s}}$ is limited such that the short-circuit current $I_{1,\mathrm{s}}$ is reaching its nominal value $I_{1,\mathrm{n}}$:
	\begin{equation}
		U_{1,\mathrm{s}} = u_{1,\mathrm{s}} U_{1,\mathrm{n}}, \quad I_{1,\mathrm{s}} = \frac{U_{1,\mathrm{s}}}{Z_\mathrm{s}} = I_{1,\mathrm{n}}.
	\end{equation}
	Here, $u_{1,\mathrm{s}}$ is the relative short-circuit voltage w.r.t. the nominal voltage $U_{1,\mathrm{n}}$. Typical values are $u_{1,\mathrm{s}} = 3 \ldots 13 \, \%.$
	\\[1em]
	While the short-circuit test is conducted with a reduced primary voltage, the prospective short-circuit (PSC) current during normal operation (typical as a fault result) can be significantly higher:
	\begin{equation}
		I_{1,\mathrm{psc}} = \frac{U_{1,\mathrm{n}}}{Z_\mathrm{s}} = \frac{U_{1,\mathrm{s}}}{Z_\mathrm{s}} = \frac{I_{1,\mathrm{n}}}{u_{1,\mathrm{s}}}.
	\end{equation} 
	Hence, the transformer parameters $Z_\mathrm{s}$ and $u_{1,\mathrm{s}}$ are crucial for the short-circuit behavior and the protection coordination of the transformer. Lower bounds are typically enforced by standards to prevent catastrophic damages, in particular in the electrical energy sector.

	If the voltage to be measured is too high for direct measurement, a voltage transformer can be used to step-down the voltage to a suitable level:
	$$u_2(t) = \frac{1}{\ddot{u}} u_1(t).$$
	Hence, we choose $\ddot{u} > 1$. Moreover, the voltage sensor on the secondary side comes with a high internal resistance $R_\mathrm{i}$ to avoid a significant current and, therefore, power flow. Neglecting the leakage inductance, we can model the voltage transformer as shown in \figref{fig:Voltage_transformer_meas_ECD} with
	$$	R'_\mathrm{i} = \ddot{u}^2R_\mathrm{i}, \qquad R'_2 = \ddot{u}^2R_2, \qquad M' = L_{1,\mathrm{m}}.$$
	The primary RL circuit represents a high-pass filter for the voltage signal, i.e., the transformer is only suitable for AC signals with $\omega_{\mathrm{el}} > R_1/M'$ (cutoff frequency).

%% Autotransformer -- step-down configuration %%

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Autotransformer -- step-down configuration}
	Assuming idealized conditions (no leakage, no losses), the apparent power of the standard transformer $S$ and of the autotransformer $S_\mathrm{at}$ are:
	\begin{equation}
		S= U_1 I_1 = U_2 I_2, \qquad S_\mathrm{at} = (U_1+U_2) I_1 = U_2 (I_2-I_1).
		\label{eq:apparent_power_autotransformer}
	\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Autotransformer -- step-down configuration  (cont.) %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Autotransformer -- step-down configuration  (cont.)}
	From \eqref{eq:apparent_power_autotransformer} we can express the autotransformer apparent power $S_\mathrm{at}$ in terms of the standard transformer apparent power $S$:
	\begin{equation}
		S_\mathrm{at} = (U_1+U_2) I_1 = S + U_2 I_1 = S + U_1 I_1 \frac{U_2}{U_1} = S(1+\frac{1}{\ddot{u}}).
	\end{equation}
	Here, $\ddot{u}$ is the (idealized) voltage transformation ratio of the standard transformer -- compare \eqref{eq:voltage_transformation_ratio}.  Hence, we can express the apparent power of the autotransformer in terms of the standard transformer apparent power:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{S_\mathrm{at}}{S} = 1+\frac{1}{\ddot{u}} = 1 + \frac{N_2}{N_1}.
	\end{equation}
	Since $N_2 / N_1 > 0$ the autotransformer can transfer more apparent power than the standard transformer since the autotransformer combines two power transfer mechanisms:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the apparent power $U_1 I_1$ is transferred via the magnetic coupling (induction) and
		\item the apparent power $U_2 I_1$ is transferred via the electrical conduction between primary and secondary (not available in the standard transformer).
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Autotransformer -- step-up configuration %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Autotransformer -- step-up configuration}
	The apparent power of the step-up autotransformer is

		S_\mathrm{at} = U_1 (I_1-I_2) = (U_1+U_2)I_2 = S(1+\frac{U_1}{U_2})= S(1+\ddot{u})= S(1+\frac{N_1}{N_2}).
	\end{equation}
	Likewise to the step-down autotransformer, the step-up autotransformer can transfer more apparent power than the standard transformer.

			The previous analysis has revealed that the apparent power boost over the standard transformer is significant if

            \end{itemize}

	Another challenge of the autotransformer is its short-circuit behavior. From the step-up case we know:
	$$ S_\mathrm{at} = S(1+\frac{N_1}{N_2}).$$ 
	Dividing both sides by $U_1$ delivers
	\begin{equation}
		I_{1,\mathrm{at}} = I_{1}(1+\frac{N_1}{N_2})
	\end{equation}
	Hence, in case of a short circuit the steady-state current of the autotransformer is $1+N_1/N_2$ times higher than the standard transformer:
	\begin{equation}
		I_{1,\mathrm{at,psc}} = I_{1,\mathrm{psc}}(1+\frac{N_1}{N_2}).
	\end{equation}
	The same applies to the step-down case. Therefore, the autotransformer may require additional short-circuit protection measures to prevent damages (e.g., additional choke).

	Assuming a three-phase transformer without mutual coupling between the phases abc (as in the three independent single-phase transformers from \figref{fig:Three_phase_transformer_simple}) and without saturation, the magnetic flux linkage of the primary and secondary side can be expressed as
		\begin{equation}
			\bm{\psi}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_{1\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ \psi_{1\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ \psi_{1\mathrm{c}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{c}}(t)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} L_{1\mathrm{a}} & 0 & 0 & M_{\mathrm{a}} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & L_{1\mathrm{b}} & 0 & 0 & M_{\mathrm{b}} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & L_{1\mathrm{c}} & 0 & 0 &M_{\mathrm{c}} \\ M_{\mathrm{a}} & 0 & 0 & L_{2\mathrm{a}} & 0 &0 \\ 0 & M_{\mathrm{b}} & 0 & 0 & L_{2\mathrm{b}} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & M_{\mathrm{c}} & 0 & 0 &L_{2\mathrm{c}}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_{1\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ i_{1\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ i_{1\mathrm{c}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{c}}(t)\end{bmatrix} = \bm{L}\bm{i}(t).
		\end{equation}
		If the transformer's magnetic three-phase circuit is ideally symmetric, also
		$$ M = M_{\mathrm{a}} = M_{\mathrm{b}} = M_{\mathrm{c}}, \quad L_1 = L_{1\mathrm{a}} = L_{1\mathrm{b}} = L_{1\mathrm{c}}, \quad L_2 = L_{2\mathrm{a}} = L_{2\mathrm{b}} = L_{2\mathrm{c}}$$
		holds.

	Hence, we have
		\begin{equation}
			\bm{\psi}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_{1\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ \psi_{1\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ \psi_{1\mathrm{c}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{c}}(t)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} L_{1} & 0 & 0 & M & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & L_{1} & 0 & 0 & M & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & L_{1} & 0 & 0 & M \\ M & 0 & 0 & L_{2} & 0 &0 \\ 0 & M & 0 & 0 & L_{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & M & 0 & 0 &L_{2}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_{1\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ i_{1\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ i_{1\mathrm{c}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{c}}(t)\end{bmatrix} = \bm{L}\bm{i}(t).
		\end{equation}
		The voltage equation results from Faraday's law and Ohm's law:
		\begin{equation}
			\bm{u}(t) = \bm{R}\bm{i}(t)+ \bm{L}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\bm{i}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} R_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & R_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & R_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & R_{2} & 0 &0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & R_{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &R_{2}\end{bmatrix}\bm{i}(t)+ \bm{L}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\bm{i}(t).
		\end{equation}

	Due to the ideal three-phase symmetry, the model relation per phase pair on the primary and secondary side are identical for all three phases, i.e., we can split up the model into:  
	\begin{align}
		\begin{bmatrix}	u_\mathrm{1a}(t)\\u_\mathrm{2a}(t) \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix} R_1 & 0 \\ 0 & R_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1a}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2a}(t) \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} L_1 & M \\ M & L_2 \end{bmatrix} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1a}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2a}(t) \end{bmatrix}, \\   
		\begin{bmatrix}	u_\mathrm{1b}(t)\\u_\mathrm{2b}(t) \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix} R_1 & 0 \\ 0 & R_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1b}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2b}(t) \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} L_1 & M \\ M & L_2 \end{bmatrix} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1b}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2b}(t) \end{bmatrix},\\
		\begin{bmatrix}	u_\mathrm{1c}(t)\\u_\mathrm{2c}(t) \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix} R_1 & 0 \\ 0 & R_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1c}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2c}(t) \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} L_1 & M \\ M & L_2 \end{bmatrix} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1c}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2c}(t) \end{bmatrix}.
	\end{align}
	Hence, under the made assumptions the single-phase transformer ECD from \figref{fig:Transformer_T_ECD} can be used to also model the three-phase transformer.
