                A transformer is a static device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. It converts the AC voltage levels between inputs and outputs.   
            \end{varblock}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item<2-> While a transformer is sometimes called a \enquote{static~machine}, it does not meet the formal definition of an electrical machine (compare first chapter).
                \item<3-> However, transformers share some working principles with electrical machines and are also often used as components of electrical power systems including drives.

		Rearranging \eqref{eq:transformer_differential_equations_matrix_form} gives the \hl{state-space representation} of the transformer model
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\bm{i}(t) = \bm{L}^{-1}\left(\bm{u}(t)-\bm{R}\bm{i}(t) \right)
			\label{eq:transformer_state_space_01}
		\end{equation}
		with
		$$ \renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.3} \bm{L}^{-1} = \frac{1}{L_1L_2 - M^2} \begin{bmatrix} L_2 & -M \\ -M & L_1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sigma} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{L_1} &  \frac{-M}{L_1 L_2} \\ \frac{-M}{L_1 L_2} & \frac{1}{L_2} \end{bmatrix}.$$
		\pause
		Above, $\sigma$ is the \hl{leakage coefficient} defined as (compare also \eqref{eq:coupling_coefficient})
		\begin{equation}
			\sigma = \frac{L_1 L_2 -M^2}{L_1 L_2 } = 1 - \frac{M^2}{ L_1 L_2} = 1 - k^2 .
			\label{eq:leakage_coefficient}
		\end{equation}
		\pause
		Finally, the state-space representation of the transformer model (with the currents as states) is
		\begin{equation}
			\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.3} 
			\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\bm{i}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{R_1}{\sigma L_1} & \frac{R_2 M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} \\ \frac{R_1 M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} & -\frac{R_2}{\sigma L_2} \end{bmatrix} \bm{i}(t) + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sigma L_1} & -\frac{M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} \\ -\frac{M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} & \frac{1}{\sigma L_2} \end{bmatrix} \bm{u}(t) = \bm{A} \bm{i}(t) + \bm{B} \bm{u}(t) .

%% Steady-state of the single-phase transformer %%

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Steady-state modeling of the single-phase transformer}
		Assuming that the transformer operates in steady state and that all quantities are sinusoidal, the state-space model \eqref{eq:transformer_state_space_02} can be simplified and represented by \hl{complex phasors}:
			$$x(t) = \hat{x} \cos(\omega_\mathrm{el} t+ \varphi_{\mathrm{x}}) = \mathrm{Re}\left\{\hat{x} e^{\iu (\omega_\mathrm{el} t + \varphi_{\mathrm{x}})}\right\}= \mathrm{Re}\left\{\underline{X} e^{\iu \omega_\mathrm{el} t}\right\}.$$
			\pause
		From \eqref{eq:transformer_differential_equations_matrix_form} we receive
		\begin{align}
			\bm{\underline{U}} = \begin{bmatrix} \underline{U}_1 \\ \underline{U}_2 \end{bmatrix} = \bm{R}\bm{\underline{I}} + \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} \bm{L}\bm{\underline{I}} = \bm{\underline{Z}}\, \bm{\underline{I} } = \begin{bmatrix} R_1 + \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} L_1 & \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} M \\ \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} M & R_2 + \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} L_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \underline{I}_1 \\ \underline{I}_2 \end{bmatrix}.
			\label{eq:transformer_steady_state_voltage_response}
		\end{align}
		\pause
		For some given $\bm{\underline{U}}$ we can calculate the current phasor $\bm{\underline{I}}$ (i.e., the steady-state current response) by solving:
		\begin{align}
			\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.3} 
			\bm{\underline{I}} = \bm{\underline{Z}}^{-1} \bm{\underline{U}} .
			\label{eq:transformer_steady_state_current_response}
		\end{align}
		\pause
		Alternative scenarios can be also considered, e.g., defining $\underline{U}_1$ (input voltage) and $\underline{I}_2$ (load current) as given and solving for $\underline{I}_1$ and $\underline{U}_2$ by rearranging \eqref{eq:transformer_steady_state_voltage_response}. 
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Steady-state of the single-phase transformer (cont.) %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Steady-state modeling of the single-phase transformer (cont.)}
		Assuming that the transformer is not loaded ($I_2 = 0$) and that it is lossless ($R_1 = 0$), \eqref{eq:transformer_steady_state_voltage_response} simplifies to
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{bmatrix} \underline{U}_1 \\ \underline{U}_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} L_1  \\ \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} M  \end{bmatrix} \underline{I}_1.
		\end{equation} \pause
		The voltage transformation ratio in this case results in
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{U_1}{U_2} = \frac{\iu \omega_{\mathrm{el}} L_1 I_1}{\iu \omega_{\mathrm{el}} M I_1}  = \frac{L_1}{M}.
		\end{equation}
		\pause
		Assuming further that the transformer is leakage-free ($L_{1,\sigma}=0$), the \hl{voltage transformation ratio} simplifies to (compare also \eqref{eq:inductance_split})
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{U_1}{U_2} = \frac{L_1}{M} = \frac{\Lambda_{21}N_1^2}{\Lambda_{21}N_1 N_2}  = \frac{N_1}{N_2} = \ddot{u}.
			\label{eq:voltage_transformation_ratio}
		\end{equation}
		\pause
		Hence, this famous result is only valid for the abstract case of a lossless, leakage-free, and, unloaded transformer -- i.e., not (exactly) applicable to real-world transformers.

	Short-circuiting the secondary and applying a sinusoidal test voltage $U_{1,\mathrm{s}}$,  we can determine
	\begin{equation}
		Z_\mathrm{s} = \sqrt{(R_1+R'_2)^2 + (X_{L_{1,\sigma}} + X_{L'_{2,\sigma}})^2}, \quad  \cos(\varphi_{\mathrm{s}}) = \frac{P_{1,\mathrm{s}}}{U_{1,\mathrm{s}} I_{1,\mathrm{s}}}
	\end{equation} 
	with $Z_\mathrm{s}$ being the short-circuit impedance while assuming that the impedance across $M'$ and $R_{\mathrm{c}}$ is much larger, i.e., the short-circuit current will not flow via this branch. \pause Hence, we have
	\begin{equation}
		R_1+R'_2 = Z_\mathrm{s}\cos(\varphi_{\mathrm{s}}), \quad X_{L_{1,\sigma}} + X_{L'_{2,\sigma}} = Z_\mathrm{s} \sin(\varphi_{\mathrm{s}}).
	\end{equation}  
	\pause
	Since we have four remaining unknown component values but only two independent equations, we additionally assume a symmetrical transformer design, leading to
	\begin{equation}
		R_1 = R'_2 = \frac{1}{2}Z_\mathrm{s}\cos(\varphi_{\mathrm{s}}), \quad \omega_{\mathrm{el}}L_{1,\sigma} =  X_{L_{1,\sigma}} = \omega_{\mathrm{el}}L'_{2,\sigma} = X_{L'_{2,\sigma}} = \frac{1}{2} Z_\mathrm{s} \sin(\varphi_{\mathrm{s}}).

	Typically the short-circuit test voltage $U_{1,\mathrm{s}}$ is limited such that the short-circuit current $I_{1,\mathrm{s}}$ is reaching its nominal value $I_{1,\mathrm{n}}$:
	\begin{equation}
		U_{1,\mathrm{s}} = u_{1,\mathrm{s}} U_{1,\mathrm{n}}, \quad I_{1,\mathrm{s}} = \frac{U_{1,\mathrm{s}}}{Z_\mathrm{s}} = I_{1,\mathrm{n}}.
	\end{equation}
	Here, $u_{1,\mathrm{s}}$ is the relative short-circuit voltage w.r.t. the nominal voltage $U_{1,\mathrm{n}}$. \pause Typical values are $u_{1,\mathrm{s}} = 3 \ldots 13 \, \%.$ \pause
	\\[1em]
	While the short-circuit test is conducted with a reduced primary voltage, the prospective short-circuit (PSC) current during normal operation (typical as a fault result) can be significantly higher:
	\begin{equation}
		I_{1,\mathrm{psc}} = \frac{U_{1,\mathrm{n}}}{Z_\mathrm{s}} = \frac{U_{1,\mathrm{s}}}{Z_\mathrm{s}} = \frac{I_{1,\mathrm{n}}}{u_{1,\mathrm{s}}}.
	\end{equation}  \pause
	Hence, the transformer parameters $Z_\mathrm{s}$ and $u_{1,\mathrm{s}}$ are crucial for the short-circuit behavior and the protection coordination of the transformer. Lower bounds are typically enforced by standards to prevent catastrophic damages, in particular in the electrical energy sector.

\begin{frame}

	Assuming idealized conditions (no leakage, no losses), the apparent power of the standard transformer $S$ and of the autotransformer $S_\mathrm{at}$ are:
	\begin{equation}
		S= U_1 I_1 = U_2 I_2, \qquad S_\mathrm{at} = (U_1+U_2) I_1 = U_2 (I_2-I_1).

%% Autotransformer -- step-down configuration  (cont.) %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Autotransformer -- step-down configuration  (cont.)}
	From \eqref{eq:apparent_power_autotransformer} we can express the autotransformer apparent power $S_\mathrm{at}$ in terms of the standard transformer apparent power $S$:
	\begin{equation}
		S_\mathrm{at} = (U_1+U_2) I_1 = S + U_2 I_1 = S + U_1 I_1 \frac{U_2}{U_1} = S(1+\frac{1}{\ddot{u}}).
	\end{equation}
	Here, $\ddot{u}$ is the (idealized) voltage transformation ratio of the standard transformer -- compare \eqref{eq:voltage_transformation_ratio}. \pause Hence, we can express the apparent power of the autotransformer in terms of the standard transformer apparent power:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{S_\mathrm{at}}{S} = 1+\frac{1}{\ddot{u}} = 1 + \frac{N_2}{N_1}.
	\end{equation} \pause
	For $N_2 / N_1 > 0$ the autotransformer can transfer more apparent power than the standard transformer since the \hl{autotransformer combines two power transfer mechanisms}: \pause
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the apparent power $U_1 I_1$ is transferred via the magnetic coupling (induction) and \pause
		\item the apparent power $U_2 I_1$ is transferred via the electrical conduction between primary and secondary (not available in the galvanically-isolated standard transformer).

	Another challenge of the autotransformer is its short-circuit behavior. From the step-up case we know:
	$$ S_\mathrm{at} = S(1+\frac{N_1}{N_2}).$$ 
	\pause
	Dividing both sides by $U_1$ delivers
	\begin{equation}
		I_{1,\mathrm{at}} = I_{1}(1+\frac{N_1}{N_2}).
	\end{equation}
	\pause
	Hence, in case of a short circuit the steady-state current of the autotransformer is $1+N_1/N_2$ times higher than the standard transformer:
	\begin{equation}
		I_{1,\mathrm{at,psc}} = I_{1,\mathrm{psc}}(1+\frac{N_1}{N_2}).
	\end{equation}
	\pause
	The same applies to the step-down case. Therefore, the autotransformer may require additional short-circuit protection measures to prevent damages (e.g., additional choke).

	Assuming a three-phase transformer without mutual coupling between the phases abc (as in the three independent single-phase transformers from \figref{fig:Three_phase_transformer_simple}) and without saturation, the magnetic flux linkage of the primary and secondary side can be expressed as
		\begin{equation}
			\bm{\psi}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_{1\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ \psi_{1\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ \psi_{1\mathrm{c}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{c}}(t)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} L_{1\mathrm{a}} & 0 & 0 & M_{\mathrm{a}} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & L_{1\mathrm{b}} & 0 & 0 & M_{\mathrm{b}} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & L_{1\mathrm{c}} & 0 & 0 &M_{\mathrm{c}} \\ M_{\mathrm{a}} & 0 & 0 & L_{2\mathrm{a}} & 0 &0 \\ 0 & M_{\mathrm{b}} & 0 & 0 & L_{2\mathrm{b}} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & M_{\mathrm{c}} & 0 & 0 &L_{2\mathrm{c}}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_{1\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ i_{1\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ i_{1\mathrm{c}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{c}}(t)\end{bmatrix} = \bm{L}\bm{i}(t).
		\end{equation}
		\pause
		If the transformer's magnetic three-phase circuit is ideally symmetric, also
		$$ M = M_{\mathrm{a}} = M_{\mathrm{b}} = M_{\mathrm{c}}, \quad L_1 = L_{1\mathrm{a}} = L_{1\mathrm{b}} = L_{1\mathrm{c}}, \quad L_2 = L_{2\mathrm{a}} = L_{2\mathrm{b}} = L_{2\mathrm{c}}$$
		holds.

	Hence, we have
		\begin{equation}
			\bm{\psi}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_{1\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ \psi_{1\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ \psi_{1\mathrm{c}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ \psi_{2\mathrm{c}}(t)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} L_{1} & 0 & 0 & M & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & L_{1} & 0 & 0 & M & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & L_{1} & 0 & 0 & M \\ M & 0 & 0 & L_{2} & 0 &0 \\ 0 & M & 0 & 0 & L_{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & M & 0 & 0 &L_{2}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_{1\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ i_{1\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ i_{1\mathrm{c}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{a}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{b}}(t) \\ i_{2\mathrm{c}}(t)\end{bmatrix} = \bm{L}\bm{i}(t).
			\label{eq:Three_phase_transformer_flux_linkage}
		\end{equation}
		\pause
		The voltage equation results from Faraday's law and Ohm's law:
		\begin{equation}
			\bm{u}(t) = \bm{R}\bm{i}(t)+ \bm{L}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\bm{i}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} R_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & R_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & R_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & R_{2} & 0 &0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & R_{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &R_{2}\end{bmatrix}\bm{i}(t)+ \bm{L}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\bm{i}(t).

	Due to the ideal three-phase symmetry, the model relation per phase pair on the primary and secondary side are identical for all three phases, i.e., we can split up the model into:  
	\begin{align}
		\begin{bmatrix}	u_\mathrm{1a}(t)\\u_\mathrm{2a}(t) \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix} R_1 & 0 \\ 0 & R_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1a}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2a}(t) \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} L_1 & M \\ M & L_2 \end{bmatrix} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1a}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2a}(t) \end{bmatrix}, \\   
		\begin{bmatrix}	u_\mathrm{1b}(t)\\u_\mathrm{2b}(t) \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix} R_1 & 0 \\ 0 & R_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1b}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2b}(t) \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} L_1 & M \\ M & L_2 \end{bmatrix} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1b}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2b}(t) \end{bmatrix},\\
		\begin{bmatrix}	u_\mathrm{1c}(t)\\u_\mathrm{2c}(t) \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix} R_1 & 0 \\ 0 & R_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1c}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2c}(t) \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} L_1 & M \\ M & L_2 \end{bmatrix} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \begin{bmatrix} i_\mathrm{1c}(t)\\i_\mathrm{2c}(t) \end{bmatrix}.
	\end{align}
	\pause
	Hence, under the made assumptions the same ECD from \figref{fig:Transformer_T_ECD} for the single-phase transformer case can be also used to model the three-phase transformer.
