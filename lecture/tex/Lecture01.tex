\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Why is knowledge about electric machines and drives important?}
	\begin{varblock}{Electric machines and drives are an essential pillar of the modern society}
		Without electric machines and drives, our todays society would not be possible. Starting from providing electricity via electrical generators to powering electric vehicles, tools and entire factory production lines, electric machines and drives are everywhere, that is, they enable our today's living standard. 
	\end{varblock}
	\begin{varblock}{Energy efficiency and sustainability is key}<2->
		Electric machines and drives utilize  approx. 50\,\% of the global electricity with about 8 billion electric motors in use in the EU (source: \href{https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/energy-label-and-ecodesign/energy-efficient-products/electric-motors-and-variable-speed-drives_en}{European Commission} and \href{https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/d69b2a76-feb9-4a74-a921-2490a8fefcdf/EE_for_ElectricSystems.pdf}{International Energy Agency}). Therefore, improving their efficiency is an essential factor to reduce the global energy consumption and the associated CO$_2$ emissions.
