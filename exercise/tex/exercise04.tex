\task{Fourier analysis of a field distribution of a three-phase winding}
The winding of a three-phase and four-pole machine is described with the following parameters. The number of notches is given with $q$ = 2 and the winding chording is $y/\rho_{\mathrm{p}}$ = 5/6. The number of windings per coil is given with $N_{\mathrm{c}}$ = 5 with $a$ = 1. The air gap is given with $\delta$ = 1 mm and the inner stator diameter is $d_{\mathrm{s}}$ = 80 mm. The phase current root mean square value is given with $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ = 30  A.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subtask{Calculate the number of slots per pole pair. In addition, determine the pole pitch $\rho_{\mathrm{p}}$ as an angular information and calculate the pole pitch $\tau_{\mathrm{p}}$ as a distance in m. Furthermore, determine the number of conductors per phase.}

\begin{solutionblock}
    The number of slots is calculated with
    \begin{equation}
        Q = q 2 p m
        = 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 3
        = 24,
    \end{equation}
    where $p$ is the number of pole pairs and $m$ is the number of phases. Therefore, the number of slots per pole pair is given with:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{Q}{p} = \frac{24}{2} = 12.
    \end{equation}

    The pole pitch as an angular information is calculated with
    \begin{equation}
        \rho_{\mathrm{p}} = \frac{\pi}{p}
        = \frac{\pi}{2},
    \end{equation}
    and in comparison, the pole pitch as a distance information is determined as:
    \begin{equation}
        \tau_{\mathrm{p}} = \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}\pi}{2p}
        = \frac{\SI{80}{\milli \metre \cdot \pi}}{2 \cdot 2}
        = \SI{62.8}{\milli\metre}.
    \end{equation}

    The conductors per phase are calculated by:
    \begin{equation}
        N_{\mathrm{a}} = \frac{2pqN_{\mathrm{c}}}{a}
        = \frac{2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 5}{1}
        = 40.
    \end{equation}
\end{solutionblock}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subtask{Calculate the amplitude of the flux density fundamental in the air gap assuming an ideal homogenous and block-shaped flux distribution along the stator circumference.}

\begin{solutionblock}
    The maximum flux density is given with:
    \begin{equation}
        \hat{B} = \frac{\mu_{\mathrm{0}}N \hat{i}}{2 \delta}
        = \frac{\SI{4\pi\cdot10^{-7}}{\volt\second\per\ampere\metre}\cdot 40 \cdot \SI{\left(30\cdot \sqrt{2} \right)}{\ampere}}{2\cdot \SI{0.001}{\metre}}
        = \SI{1.07}{\volt\second}.
    \end{equation}

    The general form to calculate the flux density for phase a of a harmonic order is defined by
    \begin{equation}
        \hat{B}_{\mathrm{a}}^{(k)}(t) = \frac{4}{\pi} \hat{B} \cos(\omega t) \frac{1}{k} \xi_{\mathrm{d,}k} \xi_{\mathrm{p,}k},
        \label{eq:harmonicOrderFluxDensity}
    \end{equation}
    with $\xi_{\mathrm{d,}k}$ is the distribution and $\xi_{\mathrm{p,}k}$ is the pitch factor. Hence, for the fundamental wave is $k$ = 1, which leads to
    \begin{equation}
        \xi_{\mathrm{d,}1} = \frac{\sin\left( \frac{1\cdot \pi}{2m}\right)}{q\sin\left(\frac{1\cdot\pi}{2mq}\right)}
        = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{1\cdot\pi}{2\cdot3}\right)}{2\cdot \sin\left(\frac{1\cdot\pi}{2\cdot3\cdot2}\right)}
        = 0.966,
        \label{eq:distributionFactor}
    \end{equation}
    and,
    \begin{equation}
        \xi_{\mathrm{p,}1} = \sin\left(1\cdot \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{y}{\rho_{\mathrm{p}}} \right)
        = \sin\left(1 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \right)
        = 0.966.
        \label{eq:pitchFactor}
    \end{equation}

    Finally, \eqref{eq:harmonicOrderFluxDensity} is multiplied by a factor of $\frac{3}{2}$ to calculate the amplitude of the fundamental wave of the three phases acting on the air gap flux. This leads to:
    \begin{equation}
        \hat{B}^{(1)} = \frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{4}{\pi} \cdot \SI{1.07}{\volt\second} \cdot \frac{1}{1} \cdot 0.966 \cdot 0.966
        = \SI{1.27}{\volt\second}.

    \end{equation}

Give the results as relative fractions to the amplitude of the fundamental wave. In addition, calculate the distribution, pitch and winding factor for the given harmonics and the fundamental wave.}

\begin{solutionblock}
    The flux density for the harmonic orders is calculated with \eqref{eq:Fourier_threePhases}. The pitch factors are determined with \eqref{eq:pitchFactor} and the distribution factors with \eqref{eq:distributionFactor}. The winding factor is given with:
    \begin{equation}
        \xi_{\mathrm{w,}k} = \xi_{\mathrm{d,}k} \xi_{\mathrm{p,}k}.
    \end{equation}

    For the calculation up to the $19\textsuperscript{th}$ harmonic, a short Python script is written.
    The results are visualized in \autoref{tab:windingFactors}.

\task{Distributed windings}
Consider a 4-pole three-phase motor with 15 stator slots. A simplified sketch of this motor with the winding scheme of phase a is shown in \autoref{fig:MMF_distributed}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{ex04/MMF_distributed.pdf}
    \caption{Simplified sketch of a distributed winding scheme. Only phase a is shown.}
    \label{fig:MMF_distributed}
\end{figure}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subtask{Determine the pole pitch $\rho_{\mathrm{p}}$ and the number of notches. Is it an integral-slot or a fractional-slot winding?}

\begin{solutionblock}
    The number of slots are shown in the figure, which leads to $Q$ = 15. Furthermore, the number of phases is given in the task, that is $m$ = 3.

    Hence, the pole pitch is calculated as:
    \begin{equation}
        \rho_{\mathrm{p}} = \frac{2\pi}{2p}
        = \frac{\pi}{2}.
    \end{equation}
    
    The number of notches is defined with:
    \begin{equation}
        q = \frac{Q}{2pm} = \frac{15}{2\cdot 2 \cdot 3}
        = \frac{15}{12} = \frac{5}{4}.
    \end{equation}
    Since the number of notches per pole and phase is not an integer, it is a fractional slot winding.
    The coil width $y$ is three stator slots, which leads to the angular coil width:
    \begin{equation}
        w = \frac{2\pi}{Q}m
        = \frac{2\pi}{15} \cdot 3
        = \frac{2\pi}{5}.
    \end{equation}

    Therefore, the chording factor is determined with:
    \begin{equation}
        s = \frac{w}{\tau_{\mathrm{p}}}
        = \frac{6\pi \cdot 2}{15 \pi}
        =\frac{12}{15}.
    \end{equation}

    \label{tab:distributed_winding}
\end{table}

\begin{solutionblock}
    In the task only phase a of the winding scheme is given. However, to complete the winding scheme, phase b must have an electrical phase shift of $\SI{120}{\degree}$ and phase c of $\SI{240}{\degree}$ respectively.
    This leads to
    \begin{equation}
        n_{\mathrm{b}} p \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{Q} = \SI{120}{\degree} \ \mathrm{mod} \ \SI{360}{\degree},
    \end{equation}
    where $n_{\mathrm{b}}$ is the displacement in slots. This expression is rewritten into
    \begin{equation}
        n_{\mathrm{b}} p \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{Q} = \SI{120}{\degree} + k \SI{360}{\degree},
        \label{eq:nb}
    \end{equation}
    and also for phase c:
    \begin{equation}
        n_{\mathrm{c}} p \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{Q} = \SI{240}{\degree} + k \SI{360}{\degree}.
        \label{eq:nc}
    \end{equation}
    
    Now, an integral solution must be found for \eqref{eq:nb} and \eqref{eq:nc} to determine the winding scheme.
    This is done with trial and error, the first assumption is $n_{\mathrm{b}} = 10, k = 1$, which results in
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            10\cdot 2\cdot \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{15} &= \SI{120}{\degree}+\SI{360}{\degree}, \\
            \SI{480}{\degree} &= \SI{480}{\degree},
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
    therefore, the requirement is fulfilled. For phase c the assumption is given with $n_{\mathrm{c}} = 5, k = 1$ into \eqref{eq:nc}
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            5 \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{15} &= \SI{240}{\degree} + k \SI{360}{\degree}, \\
            \SI{240}{\degree} &= \SI{240}{\degree},
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
    which fulfills the requirement too.
    With the calculated phase shift and the knowledge of the coil width of three slots from the figure, the winding scheme is completed.
    In \autoref{tab:solution_distributedWinding} the inputs and outputs of each winding are given.

\subtask{Calculate the complex winding factors $\underline{\xi}_{\mathrm{a,}k}$ for the fundamental as well as for the $5\textsuperscript{th}$ and $7\textsuperscript{th}$ harmonic.}

\begin{solutionblock}
    The complex winding factor is defined by
    \begin{equation}
        \xi_{\mathrm{a,}k} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{j}N_{\mathrm{a}}} \sum_{i=1}^{Q} N_{\mathrm{a,}i}e^{\mathrm{j}k\vartheta_{\mathrm{el,a,}i}},

    with
    \begin{equation}
        N_{\mathrm{a}} = \sum_{i=1}^{Q} |N_{\mathrm{a,}i} |,
    \end{equation}
    and the electrical angle:
    \begin{equation}
        \vartheta_{\mathrm{el,a,}i} = \vartheta_{\mathrm{a,}i} \cdot p.
    \end{equation}

    The mechanical angles are calculated with
    \begin{equation}
        \vartheta_{\mathrm{a,}i} = \left(i-1 \right) \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{Q}
        = \left(i-1 \right) \cdot \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{15}
        = \left(i-1 \right) \cdot \SI{24}{\degree},
    \end{equation}
    where $i$ represents the number of the stator slot.
    Therefore, the mechanical angles are given in \autoref{tab:mechanicalAngles_distributedWinding}.

    To calculate the winding factors, the total number of turns of the respective phase $N_{\mathrm{a}}$ is determined for each stator slot. A negative sign indicates, that the winding turn is oriented towards the negative $z$-axis. When no conductor is in a slot, $N_{\mathrm{a,}i}$ = 0.

    For the fundamental wave $k$ = 1 applies and, therefore, with \eqref{eq:complexWindingFactor}, the winding factor of the fundamental wave calculates as follows

    For the $5\textsuperscript{th}$ harmonic is $k$ = 5, which results in

    \begin{equation}
        B^{(1)}(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}},t) = \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \cos(\omega t - \vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}).
    \end{equation}

    The flux linkage of phase a is calculated as
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_{\mathrm{a,}k}(t) = l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},k}| \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} B(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}},t) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}},
        \label{eq:phi_a_k}
    \end{equation}
    with the complex winding factor to cover the winding distribution inside the stator.
    Hence, the fundamental wave calculates as follows:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \phi_{\mathrm{a,}1}(t) &= l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(\omega t - \vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} \\
            &= l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{3}{\pi p} \hat{B}
            \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\cos(\omega t) \cos(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) + \sin(\omega t) \sin(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} \\
            &= l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{3}{\pi p} \hat{B}
            \left[\cos(\omega t) \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} + \sin(\omega t) \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d} \vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} \right] \\
            &= l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{3}{\pi p} \hat{B}
            \left[\cos(\omega t) \left[\sin(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \right]_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} + \sin(\omega t) \left[-\cos(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \right]_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \right] \\
            &= l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{3}{\pi p} \hat{B} \left[ 2 \cos(\omega t)\right] \\
            &= l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \cos(\omega t). \\
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

   Taking into account also the number of winding turns $N_{\mathrm{a}}'$, the flux linkage of phase a is given with 
    \begin{equation}
        \psi_{\mathrm{a,}k}(t) = N_{\mathrm{a}}' \phi_{\mathrm{a,}k}(t),
        \label{eq:psi_a_k}
    \end{equation}
    which results for the fundamental wave into:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \psi_{\mathrm{a,}1}(t) &= N_{\mathrm{a}}' \phi_{\mathrm{a,}k}(t) 
            = N_{\mathrm{a}}' l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}| \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \cos(\omega t) \\
            &= 30 \cdot \SI{0.35}{\metre} \cdot \SI{0.10}{\metre} \cdot \frac{6}{2\pi} \cdot \SI{1}{\tesla} \cos(\omega t) \cdot 0.9099 \\
            &= \SI{0.9123}{\volt\second} \cdot \cos(\omega t).
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

    The equation for the induced voltage of the fundamental wave is given with:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            u_{\mathrm{ind,a,}1}(t) &= -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\psi_{\mathrm{a,}1} \\
            &= -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \SI{0.9123}{\volt\second} \cdot \cos(\omega t) \\
            &= \SI{0.9123}{\volt\second} \cdot \sin(\omega t) \omega \\
            &= \SI{0.9123}{\volt\second} \cdot \sin(\omega t) \cdot 2\pi \cdot 2 \cdot \SI{\frac{250}{60}}{\per\second} \\
            &= \SI{47.78}{\volt} \cdot \sin(\omega t).
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

    The flux linkage of the $5\textsuperscript{th}$ harmonic is determined with \eqref{eq:phi_a_k}, which results into
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_{\mathrm{a},5} = 0,
    \end{equation}
    due to $|\xi_{\mathrm{a},5}|$ = 0. Therefore, the induced voltage results by:
    \begin{equation}
        u_{\mathrm{ind,a,}5}  = 0.
    \end{equation}

    With \eqref{eq:phi_a_k} the flux linkage for the $7\textsuperscript{th}$ harmonic is calculated by:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \phi_{\mathrm{a,}7}(t) &= l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},7}|
            \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B}\frac{1}{7} \sin\left(\frac{7\pi}{2}\right) \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(\omega t - 7\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} \\
            &  \vdots \\
            &= l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},7}|
            \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \frac{1}{7} \cos(\omega t).
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

    The resulting flux linkage is calculated by taking into account the number of winding turns as
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \psi_{\mathrm{a,}7} &= N_{\mathrm{a}}' \phi_{\mathrm{a,}7}(t) 
            = N_{\mathrm{a}}' l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},7}| \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \frac{1}{7} \cos(\omega t) \\
            &= 30 \cdot \SI{0.35}{\metre} \cdot \SI{\frac{10}{2}}{\metre} \cdot \frac{6}{2\pi} \cdot \SI{1}{\tesla} \cdot \frac{1}{7} \cdot \cos(\omega t) \cdot 0.087 \\
            &= \SI{0.0126}{\volt\second} \cdot \cos(\omega t),
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
    therefore, the induced voltage is given with:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            u_{\mathrm{ind,a,}7}(t) &= -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\psi_{\mathrm{a,}7} \\
            &= \SI{0.0126}{\volt\second} \cdot \sin(\omega t) \omega \\
            &= \SI{0.0126}{\volt\second} \cdot \sin(\omega t) \cdot \SI{2\pi\cdot 2\cdot \frac{250}{60}}{\per\second} \\
            &= \SI{0.66}{\volt} \cdot \sin(\omega t).

\task{Concentrated windings}
Consider the shown 10-pole 3-phase motor with 12 stator slots in \autoref{fig:MMF_concentrated}. The winding scheme of phase a is shown in the figure.

\subtask{Determine the pole pitch and und the number of notches. Is it an integral-slot or a fractional-slot winding?}

\begin{solutionblock}
    The number of slots is determined by counting the slots in the given figure of the machine.
    Hence, the number of slots is $Q$ = 12. The number of phases is given in the task, which is $m$=3.
    Therefore, the pole pitch calculates as:
    \begin{equation}
        \rho_{\mathrm{p}} = \frac{2\pi}{2p}
        = \frac{\pi}{5}.
    \end{equation}

    The number of notches is determined with:
    \begin{equation}
        q = \frac{Q}{2pm}
        = \frac{12}{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 3}
        = \frac{2}{5}.
    \end{equation}
    Since the number of notches per pole and phase is not an integer, it is a fractional slot winding.
    The coil width $y$ is one stator slot, as it is shown in the figure. This results in the angular coil width: 
    \begin{equation}
        w = \frac{2\pi}{Q}
        = \frac{2\pi}{12}
        = \frac{\pi}{6}.
    \end{equation}

    Hence, the chording factor is calculated by:
    \begin{equation}
        s = \frac{w}{\tau_{\mathrm{p}}}
        = \frac{\pi \cdot 5}{6\pi}
        = \frac{5}{6}.
    \end{equation}

\begin{solutionblock}
    In the task only phase a of the winding scheme is given. However, to complete the winding scheme, phase b must have an electrical phase shift of $\SI{120}{\degree}$ and phase c of $\SI{240}{\degree}$ respectively.
    This leads to
    \begin{equation}
        n_{\mathrm{b}} p \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{Q} = \SI{120}{\degree} \ \mathrm{mod} \ \SI{360}{\degree},
    \end{equation}
    where $n_{\mathrm{b}}$ is the displacement in slots. This expression is rewritten into
    \begin{equation}
        n_{\mathrm{b}} p \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{Q} = \SI{120}{\degree} + k \SI{360}{\degree},
        \label{eq:nb_concentrated}
    \end{equation}
    and also for phase c:
    \begin{equation}
        n_{\mathrm{c}} p \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{Q} = \SI{240}{\degree} + k \SI{360}{\degree}.
        \label{eq:nc_concentrated}
    \end{equation}
    
    Now, an integral solution must be found for \eqref{eq:nb_concentrated} and \eqref{eq:nc_concentrated} to determine the winding scheme.
    This is done with trial and error, the first assumption is $n_{\mathrm{b}} = 8, k = 3$, which results in
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            8\cdot 5\cdot \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{12} &= \SI{120}{\degree}+3 \cdot \SI{360}{\degree}, \\
            \SI{1200}{\degree} &= \SI{1200}{\degree},
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
    therefore, the requirement is fulfilled. For phase c the assumption is given with $n_{\mathrm{c}} = 4, k = 1$ into \eqref{eq:nc_concentrated} leads to
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            4 \cdot 5 \cdot \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{12} &= \SI{240}{\degree} + k \SI{360}{\degree}, \\
            \SI{600}{\degree} &= \SI{600}{\degree},
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
    which fulfills the requirement too.

    With the coil width of one slot, the resulting winding is determined. The solution of this winding scheme is shown in \autoref{tab:solution_concentratedWinding}.

    \begin{equation}
        \underline{\xi}_{\mathrm{a,}k} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{j}N_{\mathrm{a}}} \sum_{i=1}^{Q} N_{\mathrm{a,}i}e^{\mathrm{j}k\vartheta_{\mathrm{el,a,}i}},

    and the electrical angle:
    \begin{equation}
        \vartheta_{\mathrm{el,a,}i} = \vartheta_{\mathrm{a,}i} \cdot p.

    Hence, the mechanical angles are calculated as follows
    \begin{equation}

        = \left(i-1 \right)\cdot \SI{30}{\degree},

    where $i$ represents the number of the stator slot.

    For the fundamental wave, is $k$ = 1 and, therefore, with \eqref{eq:complexWindingFactor_concentratedWinding}, the winding factor of the fundamental wave calculates as follows:
    \begin{equation}
        \underline{\xi}_{\mathrm{a,}1} = \frac{1}{8j}\cdot \left[ \right. 2e^{j\cdot1\cdot5\cdot\SI{0}{\degree}}

        \left. \right]
        = -0.9330j,

    with the absolute value:
    \begin{equation}
        |\xi_{\mathrm{a,}1}| = 0.9330.
    \end{equation}

    For the $5\textsuperscript{th}$ harmonic is $k$ = 5, which results in
    \begin{equation}
        \underline{\xi}_{\mathrm{a,}5} = \frac{1}{8j}\cdot \left[ \right. 2e^{j\cdot5\cdot5\cdot\SI{0}{\degree}}

    with the absolute value:
    \begin{equation}
        |\xi_{\mathrm{a,}5}| = 0.067.
    \end{equation}

    Finally, the complex winding factor for the $7\textsuperscript{th}$ harmonic is defined as
    \begin{equation}
        |\xi_{\mathrm{a,}7}| = \frac{1}{8j}\cdot \left[ \right. 2e^{j\cdot7\cdot5\cdot\SI{0}{\degree}}

The axial length of the machine is $l=\SI{0.70}{\metre}$ and the diameter is $d = \SI{0.45}{\metre}$. The machine rotates with a mechanical speed of $n=\SI{50}{\per \minute}$. Calculate the induced voltage of phase a for the fundamental wave. What are the $5\textsuperscript{th}$ and $7\textsuperscript{th}$ harmonics of the induced voltage in phase a?}

\begin{solutionblock}
    The Fourier coefficient of the flux density is given with
    \begin{equation}
        B(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}},t) = \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \sum_{k}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k} \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{2} \right) \cos(\omega t - k \vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}),
    \end{equation}
    and for the fundamental wave:
    \begin{equation}
        B^{(1)}(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}},t) = \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \cos(\omega t - \vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}).
    \end{equation}

    The flux linkage of phase a is calculated as
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_{\mathrm{a,}k}(t) = l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},k}| \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} B(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}},t) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}},
        \label{eq:phi_a_k_concentrated}
    \end{equation}
    with the complex winding factor to cover the winding distribution inside the stator.
    Hence, the fundamental wave calculates as follows:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \phi_{\mathrm{a,}1}(t) &= l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(\omega t - \vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} \\
            &= l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{3}{\pi p} \hat{B}
            \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\cos(\omega t) \cos(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) + \sin(\omega t) \sin(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} \\
            &= l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{3}{\pi p} \hat{B}
            \left[\cos(\omega t) \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} + \sin(\omega t) \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d} \vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} \right] \\
            &= l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{3}{\pi p} \hat{B}
            \left[\cos(\omega t) \left[\sin(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \right]_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} + \sin(\omega t) \left[-\cos(\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \right]_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \right] \\
            &= l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{3}{\pi p} \hat{B} \left[ 2 \cos(\omega t)\right] \\
            &= l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}|
            \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \cos(\omega t). \\
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

   Taking into account also the number of winding turns $N_{\mathrm{a}}'$, the flux linkage of phase a is given with 
    \begin{equation}
        \psi_{\mathrm{a,}k}(t) = N_{\mathrm{a}}' \phi_{\mathrm{a,}k}(t),
        \label{eq:psi_a_k_concentrated}
    \end{equation}
    which results for the fundamental wave into:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \psi_{\mathrm{a,}1}(t) &= N_{\mathrm{a}}' \phi_{\mathrm{a,}k}(t) 
            = N_{\mathrm{a}}' l d_{\mathrm{s}} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},1}| \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \cos(\omega t) \\
            &= 137 \cdot \SI{0.7}{\metre} \cdot \SI{0.45}{\metre} \cdot \frac{6}{5\pi} \cdot \SI{1}{\tesla} \cos(\omega t) \cdot 0.9330 \\
            &= \SI{15.38}{\volt\second} \cdot \cos(\omega t).
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

    The equation for the induced voltage of the fundamental wave is given with:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            u_{\mathrm{ind,a,}1}(t) &= -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\psi_{\mathrm{a,}1} \\
            &= -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \SI{15.38}{\volt\second} \cdot \cos(\omega t) \\
            &= \SI{15.38}{\volt\second} \cdot \sin(\omega t) \omega \\
            &= \SI{15.38}{\volt\second} \cdot \sin(\omega t) \cdot 2\pi \cdot 5 \cdot \SI{\frac{50}{60}}{\per\second} \\
            &= \SI{402.6}{\volt} \cdot \sin(\omega t).
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

    The flux linkage of the $5\textsuperscript{th}$ harmonic is determined with \eqref{eq:phi_a_k_concentrated}, which results into:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \phi_{\mathrm{a,}5}(t) &= l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},5}|
            \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B}\frac{1}{5} \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{2}\right) \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(\omega t - 5\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} \\
            &  \vdots \\
            &= l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},5}|
            \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \frac{1}{5} \cos(\omega t).
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
    The resulting flux linkage is calculated by taking into account the number of winding turns as
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \psi_{\mathrm{a,}5} &= N_{\mathrm{a}}' \phi_{\mathrm{a,}5}(t) 
            = N_{\mathrm{a}}' l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},5}| \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \frac{1}{5} \cos(\omega t) \\
            &= 137 \cdot \SI{0.7}{\metre} \cdot \SI{\frac{0.45}{2}}{\metre} \cdot \frac{6}{5\pi} \cdot \SI{1}{\tesla} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \cdot \cos(\omega t) \cdot 0.0067 \\
            &= \SI{0.2208}{\volt\second} \cdot \cos(\omega t),
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
    therefore, the induced voltage is given with:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            u_{\mathrm{ind,a,}5}(t) &= -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\psi_{\mathrm{a,}5} \\
            &= \SI{0.2208}{\volt\second} \cdot \sin(\omega t) \omega \\
            &= \SI{0.2208}{\volt\second} \cdot \SI{2\pi\cdot 5\cdot \frac{50}{60}}{\per\second} \\
            &= \SI{5.78}{\volt} \cdot \sin(\omega t).
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
    

    With \eqref{eq:phi_a_k} the flux linkage for the $7\textsuperscript{th}$ harmonic is calculated by:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \phi_{\mathrm{a,}7}(t) &= l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},7}|
            \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B}\frac{1}{7} \sin\left(\frac{7\pi}{2}\right) \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(\omega t - 7\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}}) \mathrm{d}\vartheta_{\mathrm{el}} \\
            &  \vdots \\
            &= l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},7}|
            \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \frac{1}{7} \cos(\omega t).
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

    The resulting flux linkage is calculated by taking into account the number of winding turns as
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \psi_{\mathrm{a,}7} &= N_{\mathrm{a}}' \phi_{\mathrm{a,}7}(t) 
            = N_{\mathrm{a}}' l \frac{d_{\mathrm{s}}}{2} |\xi_{\mathrm{a},7}| \frac{6}{\pi p} \hat{B} \frac{1}{7} \cos(\omega t) \\
            &= 137 \cdot \SI{0.7}{\metre} \cdot \SI{\frac{45}{2}}{\metre} \cdot \frac{6}{5\pi} \cdot \SI{1}{\tesla} \cdot \frac{1}{7} \cdot \cos(\omega t) \cdot 0.067 \\
            &= \SI{0.0156}{\volt\second} \cdot \cos(\omega t),
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
    therefore, the induced voltage is given with:
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            u_{\mathrm{ind,a,}7}(t) &= -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\psi_{\mathrm{a,}7} \\
            &= \SI{0.0156}{\volt\second} \cdot \sin(\omega t) \omega \\
            &= \SI{0.0156}{\volt\second} \cdot \SI{2\pi\cdot 5\cdot \frac{50}{60}}{\per\second} \\
            &= \SI{4.13}{\volt}.
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
